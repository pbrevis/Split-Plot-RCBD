## Analysis of experimental data: Split-Plot RCBD

This repository contains [computer coding](https://github.com/pbrevis/Split-Plot-RCBD/blob/main/Data_Analysis_Split-Plot_RCBD.R) in programming lenguage 'R' to analise data from the study by Thomson et al. (1981). The experiment was a 2x4 Split-Plot organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD), with significant interaction.

Treatments are bacterial inoculation (inoculated versus not inoculated with pathogen *Erwinia carotovora*) and in-row spacing between plants (4, 6, 12 and 18 inches). Bacterial inoculation was assigned to main plots and plant spacing to subplots. The response variable is sugarbeet yield (lb/acre).

Analysis of variance and mean comparison were performed with the R package [agricolae](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/agricolae/index.html)
